## Environment variable loader

Very simple package to load the variables from a standard environment file (usually .env in the root).

Optionally allows any key within the environment file to be overridden by actual os environment variables, this is good to allow defaults and have production env variables override file defined ones.

#### Usage

`go get github.com/SamuelBanksTech/env`
